CS1632 - FALL 2015 - DELIVERABLE 1: Test Plan and Traceability Matrix

One of the diffuculty in doing this project is to determine the difference between input values and precondition. Although it is stated in the textbook (yeah I read it) that we should consider input values as methods, it's still a bit confusing. For example, in the case of testing FUN-MOVE, I use command "L" to check if player is in the same or different room as before, thus producing input values (like: "N" and "L"). The "N" command should be the precondition, but since the requirement is testing the movement, I'm still a bit unsure about it. 

For choosing test case, I have 3 cases I typically choose: Happy path, a normal expected case; long/positive extreme, a long test case which require long input or many execution steps; short/negative extreme, a short (or sometimes nothing) case which require few execution steps
